We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/robots-txt
```

## Usage

``` php
$robots = Spatie\Robots\Robots::create();

$robots->mayIndex('https://www.spatie.be/nl/admin');

$robots->mayFollowOn('https://www.spatie.be/nl/admin');
```

You can also specify a user agent:

``` php
$robots = Spatie\Robots\Robots::create('UserAgent007');

By default, `Robots` will look for a `robots.txt` file on `https://host.com/robots.txt`.
Another location can be specified like so:

``` php
$robots = Spatie\Robots\Robots::create()
    ->withTxt('https://www.spatie.be/robots-custom.txt');

$robots = Spatie\Robots\Robots::create()
    ->withTxt(__DIR__ . '/public/robots.txt');
```
